# Signed Numbers Classification
 With images of numbers in sign language, created a deep learning model using keras, tensorflow and CNN technologies to process, learn and predict numbers in sign language.



How to run app:

Source code for the App was obtained from https://github.com/tensorflow/examples

Go to this directory

examples/lite/codelabs/flower_classification/android/start/app/src/main/assets/

include any of the following tflite files, as well as the label.txt file. Running that in Andriod studios will create the application on the phone. (disregard the flower_classification folder name, it is just the example used in their tutorial.
